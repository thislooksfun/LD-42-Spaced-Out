==========

How to navigate:
  - `assets/` contains any static assets, like images or sound files. These are copied verbatim into `docs/`.
  - `docs/` contains generated content, don't modify anything in there.
  - `html/` contains any html pages. These are copied verbatim into `docs/`.
  - `less/` contains LESS files (`main.less` is compiled, all other files are ignored unless imported into `main.less`, either directly or indirectly).
  - `src/` contains all JS code (`main.js` is compiled, all other files are ignored unless required into `main.js`, either directly or indirectly).
